# Laravel Roots

This app is built under [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com) and directly inspired from [Fortify Soft-UI](https://github.com/akukoder/fortify-soft-ui) and [Tailwind Starter Kit](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/tailwind-starter-kit) projects. This app was made for self learning purpose.

## About this

I just put together some of the most commonly used Laravel components and check what got out of it. It is almost TALL stack but I chose to not work with Livewire... Somehow I don't like it.

You can also find some cheats like crsf token and timeout mamangement, but I let you discover all by yourself I'm the lazy kind.

This is now mostly admin demo and most interactions are Alpine/Axios based.

2 demo admin users and others are seeeded with regular artisan commands.
By now, that's all folks !
